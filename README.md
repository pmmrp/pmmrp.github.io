## Widening access to personalised multi-modality recovery protocols to reduce hospital admissions

### Changing perspectives of health and healthcare services
"Who you are, what you are, where you are, and what you will do" - the international communication standards between air traffic control and pilots ensure safe movement of both large and small aircraft at airports, and this approach can simplify decision making for clinicians relating to referrals for multi-modal recovery programmes (compare with existing multi-modal cardiopulmonary rehabilitation programmes for example Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust’s Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation Programme, “MyAction: Healthy Hearts and Minds”, and post-covid rehab guidelines; key terms and differences are mandatory micronutrient supplements ex NHS formulary for all patients Strong B Complex micronutrient supplements to mitigate possible thymine deficiency (increased lactate production/anaerobic metabolism/sepsis etc), Strong C supplements 1000mg+, cod liver capsules A & D standard RDA, calcium/magnesium ratio 2:1, other multiminerals standard RDA - all references will be included below).     

Applying professional discretion to interpret trends and analyse research data and suggest or participate in research towards keeping clinical guidelines up to date is a paramount duty underpinning the ethos of practice - to alleviate suffering and prolong life, recognising diversity and individual choices, and particularly aligning with identified [top research priorities](https://www.pmmrp.github.io) to establish an evidence base for the efficacy of a suite of multi-modal complementary treatments across a broad range of conditions, rather than just trialling a series of drugs for particular conditions or particular pharmaceutical companies. 

Implementing this approach alongside conventional acute care protocols can do no harm.

*Some top research priorities identified by the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnerships (funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) across the three areas of [physiotherapy](https://www.jla.nihr.ac.uk/priority-setting-partnerships/physiotherapy/Physiotherapy-top-10-priorities.htm), [nutrition/supplements](https://www.jla.nihr.ac.uk/priority-setting-partnerships/nutritional-screening-and-malnutrition/top-10.htm), and [depression and anxiety disorders (DADs)](https://www.jla.nihr.ac.uk/priority-setting-partnerships/depression/top-10-priorities/), with an already robust [evidence base](https://www.pmmrp.github.io) demanding further study:*  
- *When health problems are developing, at what point is physiotherapy most/least effective for improving patient results compared to no physiotherapy? Should physiotherapy be incorporated into certain patient bathing schedules?* 
- *How can early intervention be initiated in vulnerable groups to help prevent malnutrition, and how useful are nutritional supplements?* 
- *What are the most effective ways to prevent occurrence and recurrence of depression, and what are the best early interventions (treatments and therapies)?*

### Integration of physical and mental healthcare services 
NHS centres offer referrals to Allied Health Professions (AHP) services including dietitians, physiotherapists and psychologists - but only across a limited range of conditions.  

In line with current directives from the [World Health Organisation](https://www.pmmrp.github.io), reflected in national [govenment policy](https://www.pmmrp.github.io) and precedents set in many states in Europe [(1](https://www.usz.ch/en/clinic/complementary-and-integrative-medicine/research/cochrane-complementary-medicine-switzerland/), [2](https://psychosomatik.charite.de/), [3](https://www.klinikum.uni-heidelberg.de/zentrum-fuer-innere-medizin-medizin-klinik/klinik-fuer-allgemeine-innere-medizin-und-psychosomatik), [4)](https://www.klinikum-bochum.de/klinik-blankenstein/standort.html) relating to the integration of physical and mental healthcare services, NHS pilots [(1](https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/our-services/our-hospitals/royal-london-hospital-integrated-medicine/world-health-organization-collaborating-centre-integrative-medicine), [2](https://www.nhsggc.scot/hospitals-services/our-hospitals/gartnavel-general/nhs-centre-for-integrative-care/), [3)](https://cpmh.csp.org.uk/system/files/documents/2019-12/mental-and-physical-health-practical-ideas-q-lab-and-mind-november-2019-3.pdf) report earlier and wider access to complementary therapeutic modalities will benefit service users, although there are significant issues to resolve including logistics of localities, improving inter-sector staff training, access to treatment and interoperability of electronic medical records systems (ref 9999, ref 9999, ref 9999). 

Many of the NHS integrative healthcare pilots address conditions with limited treatment options for example palliative care in cancer, or musculoskeletal and chronic pain conditions, with and without concurrent depression and anxiety disorders (DADs) (ref 9999). This limitation coupled with late-stage application are major drawbacks with profound implications for research on efficacy of multi-modality approaches outwith the chronic conditions population. 

Early access to nutrition support (including micronutrient supplements), physical therapies (active/passive), and resilience counselling to mitigate comorbid or standalone depression and anxiety disorders (DADs) will in addition to specific therapeutic benefits also extend patient support networks and enable more professional feedback to inform collaborative clinical care pathway management for outpatients and for those in residential care (ref 9999). This move might prevent mild to moderate conditions degenerating to severe or even treatment resistant, and additionally help towards provision of more sustainable and environmentally friendly health and care services (ref 9999).

The Royal College of General Practitioners and The Society for Academic Primary Care direct medical schools and practitioners to take into account physical, psychological, social and personal factors affecting patient health and treatment options, as well as clinical guidelines (Harding et al. 2018). This directive reflects that prescribing must incorporate patients’ subjective experience (personal significance) in addition to the statistical and clinical significance of evidence-based prescribing (Sweeney et al. 1998). This focus is intended to reverse prescribing trends, facilitate improved access to alternative therapies, and promote more high-quality research into alternatives to drug therapies to shape the clinical guidelines used to inform practice (Stokes-Lampard 2019).

Since COVID-19 it is reported (ref 9999) that an increasing number of young people are on prescription medication for depression and anxiety disorders (DADs). The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) publish at least thirty clinical guidelines relating to DADs, recommending a “stepped care” pathway that might progress through “watchful waiting”, low-intensity psychosocial and psychological interventions (including digital cognitive behavioural therapy for some patient groups), before trialling psychotropic medication, usually starting with SSRIs, then other interventions for so-called treatment-resistant cases. However, it is admitted (NICE 2016) that “psychotropic drugs are still most commonly used due to lack of resources or availability of alternatives, although there is patient preference for the non-drug options, and good evidence of patient benefit where these have been used”. Chaumette et al. (2016) reported that there is also good evidence of significant adverse effects of psychotropic drugs and of multiple switching of drugs if no improvement reported and success rates of treatment steadily decline proportionately to the number of different drugs trialled. 

### Incorporation of complementary therapies into standard practice 
In order to ease the burden on NHS AHPs, a register of accredited complementary therapists is available for direct referral by other healthcare professionals, including AHP referrals. It is proposed to assign NHS roles and permitted activities with consequent implications for funding and for updating the eletronic medical records system. Until this happens, triage to allied and complementary treatments must exhibit parity with standard methodologies in taking instructions and recording treatment details, in electronic format, and in such a way to avoid service users' interrogation by multiple service providers. 

Kemshall (2009) notes the evolution of home care to reduce hospital admissions and duration of hospital stays "removes responsibility for risk and accountability from corporate to individual levels", and this might result in "user rights and patient choice being deprioritized by professional views of risk avoidance and erring on the side of caution", with the result that "low-risk cases become invisible without sufficient therapeutic engagement, and more risky individuals are coercively managed with psychotropic medication, losing sight of recovery and integration for both patient groups". Home care, whether in private sector residential developments or within “hospital at home” programmes, needs checks and balances – and this might be facilitated by extending the provision of NHS AHP/CAM therapies, with improved partnership working between mental, physical and social healthcare services.

Engagement with AHP/CAM practitioners will include screening for and mitigating the effects of prolonged immobility / bed rest [(1](https://www.nursingtimes.net/clinical-archive/deconditioning/), [2](https://www.nursingtimes.net/clinical-archive/cardiovascular/effects-of-bedrest-1-introduction-and-the-cardiovascular-system/7026883.article), [3](https://www.nursingtimes.net/clinical-archive/respiratory/effects-of-bedrest-2-respiratory-and-haematological-systems/7027192.article), [4](https://www.nursingtimes.net/clinical-archive/gastroenterology/effects-of-bedrest-3-gastrointestinal-endocrine-and-nervous-systems/7027481.article), [5](https://www.nursingtimes.net/clinical-archive/continence/effects-of-bedrest-4-renal-reproductive-and-immune-systems/7027889.article), [6](https://www.nursingtimes.net/clinical-archive/orthopaedics/effects-of-bedrest-5-the-muscles-joints-and-mobility/7028242.article), [7)](https://www.nursingtimes.net/clinical-archive/dermatology/effects-of-bedrest-6-bones-skin-self-concept-and-self-esteem-15-04-2019), dehydration and malnutrition e.g. thiamine deficiency, B-vitamins complex, C vitamins, calcium/magnesium and other essential minerals, impacting on digestion, essential for neurotransmission, intercellular communication and maintaining homeostasis, across all the systems of the body. Depending on cost/benefit analysis, initial prescription of high-dose B and C vitamins and a good multivitamin/multimineral (e.g. Glaxo Smith Kline's or similar generic) to all patients presenting with DADs might be a more effective option than psychotropic medication, both in cost and patient outcomes. Many years ago this was standard practice – Davidson's Theory and Practice of Medicine (1974) recommended prescribing high-dose B-vitamins in the psychiatry chapter, on every GPs bookshelf. This is omitted in recent editions, probably due to changing requirements for condition-specific evidence-based prescribing and the debate on optimum dosage and whether B-vitamins should be supplied individually or in combination. Kennedy (2016) presents a review finding it is best to take all the B vitamins together as taking a high-dose of one might lead to a deficiency in the others as they work synergistically to optimise neurological and brain function. 

Early nutrition interventions are more recently advocated by Adan et al. (2019), Dhir et al. (2019) and White et al. (2015) presenting reviews of many studies evidencing that a combination of multivitamin/mineral (MVM) treatments with high doses of B-vitamins reported benefits for depression and anxiety disorders (DADs), and that B-vitamin deficiency is associated with "negative neurocognitive and psychiatric consequences and thiamine deficiency in particular can present with anorexia, lethargy, mood changes, generalized malaise, confusion, irritability, agitation, tachycardia, tachypnea, muscle pain, diminished or abolished deep tendon reflexes, ataxia, paralysis, and a progressively altered level of consciousness; thus any unexplained severe neurological signs or symptoms should raise the suspicion of thiamine deficiency, especially in children". 

NICE and NHS formularies currently only include high-dose B-vitamins as part of the gold standard in nutrition support in malnutrition and for some potentially fatal alcohol-use disorders. Malnutrition is limited in NICE (2006) guidelines to those with very low BMI and recent weight loss. Lonsdale and Marrs (2017) describe that B-vitamin deficiencies are not restricted to developing countries and scarce food resources, but present as “high-calorie malnutrition” in developed countries. The double burden of undernutrition and obesity as disease is reflected in epidemiology of diet-related ill-health and mortality rates, with risk factors of physical disabilities, learning disabilities or chronic depression and anxiety disorders (DADs) resulting in reduced physical activity, unhealthy diets and weight gain after chronic psychotropic or pain medication decreasing physical activity;  mortality rates associated with obesity and cardiovascular disease in people with severe mental illness are three times higher than the general population (NICE 2017), and depression and anxiety disorders (DADs) are associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, frequently comorbid with obesity (Bucciarelli et al. 2019).

### How to participate in this research project
You can reply to the invitation sent to your secure NHS email address to confirm your interest in participation, and use the attached referral guidelines to identify any possible contra-indications to the complementary treatments before enrolling your patients. All complementary therapists are accredited and will have appropriate insurance in place. You may offer a venue for treatments, and use your own booking system, if at all possible, alternatively this may be negotiated with other participating practitioners in your locality, via the research project's electronic booking system. Negotiations are in the pipeline regarding third sector or other funding to cover consultation fees for treatments that might be outwith the current remit of NHS prescribing protocols for particular conditions, as we have noted in place at some venues. 

Details of any off-site treatments and advice given to your patients will be securely transmitted to you after the treatment, or to your referring AHP, to update the patient's medical record. Provisionally this will be via your secure NHS email address, or via your AHPs usual method of patient data capture. 

For the purposes of the research study, only anonymised details will be stored on the research database, to which you will enjoy ongoing access if you so wish. No confidential or sensitive data will be retained.

**Please note: No patients undergoing treatment for cancer will be accepted onto this programme.**
