## Personalised multi-modality recovery protocols

### Changing perspectives
"Who you are, what you are, where you are, and what you will do" - the international communication standards between air traffic control and pilots ensure safe movement of both large and small aircraft at airports, and this approach can simplify decision making across all spheres of life. 

Applying professional discretion to interpret trends and analyse research data and suggest or participate in research towards keeping clinical guidelines up to date is a paramount duty underpinning the ethos of practice - to alleviate suffering and prolong life, recognising diversity and individual choices, and particularly aligning with identified [top research priorities](https://www.pmmrp.github.io) to establish an evidence base for the efficacy of a suite of multi-modal complementary treatments across a broad range of conditions, rather than just trialling a series of drugs for particular conditions. 

Implementing this approach alongside conventional acute care protocols can do no harm.

*Some top research priorities identified by the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnerships (funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) across the three areas of [physiotherapy](https://www.jla.nihr.ac.uk/priority-setting-partnerships/physiotherapy/Physiotherapy-top-10-priorities.htm), [nutrition/supplements](https://www.jla.nihr.ac.uk/priority-setting-partnerships/nutritional-screening-and-malnutrition/top-10.htm), and [depression and anxiety disorders (DADs)](https://www.jla.nihr.ac.uk/priority-setting-partnerships/depression/top-10-priorities/), with an already robust [evidence base](https://www.pmmrp.github.io) demanding further study:*  
- *When health problems are developing, at what point is physiotherapy most/least effective for improving patient results compared to no physiotherapy? Should physiotherapy be incorporated into certain patient bathing schedules?* 
- *How can early intervention be initiated in vulnerable groups to help prevent malnutrition, and how useful are nutritional supplements?* 
- *What are the most effective ways to prevent occurrence and recurrence of depression, and what are the best early interventions (treatments and therapies)?*

### Integration of physical and mental healthcare services 
NHS centres offer referrals to Allied Health Professions (AHP) services including dietitians, physiotherapists and psychologists - but only across a limited range of conditions.  

In line with current directives from the [World Health Organisation](https://www.pmmrp.github.io), reflected in national [govenment policy](https://www.pmmrp.github.io) and precedents set in many states in Europe [(1](https://www.usz.ch/en/clinic/complementary-and-integrative-medicine/research/cochrane-complementary-medicine-switzerland/), [2](https://psychosomatik.charite.de/), [3](https://www.klinikum.uni-heidelberg.de/zentrum-fuer-innere-medizin-medizin-klinik/klinik-fuer-allgemeine-innere-medizin-und-psychosomatik), [4)](https://www.klinikum-bochum.de/klinik-blankenstein/standort.html) relating to the integration of physical and mental healthcare services, NHS pilots [(1](https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/our-services/our-hospitals/royal-london-hospital-integrated-medicine/world-health-organization-collaborating-centre-integrative-medicine), [2](https://www.nhsggc.scot/hospitals-services/our-hospitals/gartnavel-general/nhs-centre-for-integrative-care/), [3)](https://cpmh.csp.org.uk/system/files/documents/2019-12/mental-and-physical-health-practical-ideas-q-lab-and-mind-november-2019-3.pdf) report earlier and wider access to complementary therapeutic modalities will benefit service users, although there are significant issues to resolve including logistics of localities, improving inter-sector staff training, and access to treatment (ref 9999, ref 9999, ref 9999). 

Many of the NHS integrative healthcare pilots address conditions with limited treatment options for example palliative care in cancer, or musculoskeletal and chronic pain conditions, with and without concurrent mental health issues (ref 9999). This limitation coupled with late-stage application are major drawbacks with profound implications for research on efficacy of the multi-modality approach outwith the chronic conditions population. 

Early access to nutrition support (including micronutrient supplements), physical therapies (active/passive), and resilience counselling to mitigate comorbid or standalone depression and anxiety disorders (DADs) will in addition to specific therapeutic benefits also extend patient support networks and enable more professional feedback to inform collaborative clinical care pathway management for outpatients and for those in residential care (ref 9999). This move might prevent mild to moderate conditions degenerating to severe or even treatment resistant, and additionally help towards provision of more sustainable and environmentally friendly health and care services (ref 9999).

The Royal College of General Practitioners and The Society for Academic Primary Care direct medical schools and practitioners to take into account physical, psychological, social and personal factors affecting patient health and treatment options, as well as clinical guidelines (Harding et al. 2018). This directive reflects that prescribing must incorporate patients’ subjective experience (personal significance) in addition to the statistical and clinical significance of evidence-based prescribing (Sweeney et al. 1998). This focus is intended to reverse prescribing trends, facilitate improved access to alternative therapies, and promote more high-quality research into alternatives to drug therapies to shape the clinical guidelines used to inform practice (Stokes-Lampard 2019).

Since COVID-19 it is reported (ref 9999) that an increasing number of young people are on prescription medication for depression and anxiety disorders (DADs). The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) publish at least thirty clinical guidelines relating to DADs, recommending a “stepped care” pathway that might progress through “watchful waiting”, low-intensity psychosocial and psychological interventions (including digital cognitive behavioural therapy for some patient groups), before trialling psychotropic medication, usually starting with SSRIs, then other interventions for so-called treatment-resistant cases. However, it is admitted (NICE 2016) that “psychotropic drugs are still most commonly used due to lack of resources or availability of alternatives, although there is patient preference for the non-drug options, and good evidence of patient benefit where these have been used”. Chaumette et al. (2016) reported that there is also good evidence of significant adverse effects of psychotropic drugs and of multiple switching of drugs if no improvement reported and success rates of treatment steadily decline proportionately to the number of different drugs trialled. 

### Incorporation of complementary therapies into standard practice 
In order to ease the burden on NHS AHPs, a register of accredited complementary therapists is available for direct referral by other healthcare professionals, including AHP referrals. It is proposed to assign NHS roles and permitted activities with consequent implications for funding and for updating the eletronic medical records system. Until this happens, triage to allied and complementary treatments must exhibit parity with standard methodologies in taking instructions and recording treatment details, in electronic format, and in such a way to avoid service users' interrogation by multiple service providers.

### How to participate in this research project
You can reply to the invitation sent to your secure NHS email address to confirm your interest in participation, and use the attached referral guidelines to identify any possible contra-indications to the complementary treatments before enrolling your patients. All complementary therapists are accredited and will have appropriate insurance in place. You may offer a venue for treatments, and use your own booking system, if at all possible, alternatively this may be negotiated with other participating practitioners in your locality, via the research project's electronic booking system. Negotiations are in the pipeline regarding third sector or other funding to cover consultation fees for treatments that might be outwith the current remit of NHS prescribing protocols for particular conditions, as we have noted in place at some venues. 

Details of any off-site treatments and advice given to your patients will be securely transmitted to you after the treatment, or to your referring AHP, to update the patient's medical record. Provisionally this will be via your secure NHS email address, or via your AHPs usual method of patient data capture. 

For the purposes of the research study, only anonymised details will be stored on the research database, to which you will enjoy ongoing access if you so wish. No confidential or sensitive data will be retained.

**Please note: No patients undergoing treatment for cancer will be accepted onto this programme.**
