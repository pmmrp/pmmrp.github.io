## Personalised multi-modality recovery protocols

### Changing perspectives
"Who you are, what you are, where you are, and what you will do" - international communication standards between air traffic control and pilots ensure safe movement of both large and small aircraft at airports, and this approach can simplify decision making across all spheres of life. 

Applying professional discretion to interpret trends and analyse research data and suggest or participate in research towards keeping clinical guidelines up to date is a paramount duty underpinning the ethos of practice - to alleviate suffering and prolong life, recognising diversity and individual choices, and particularly aligning with identified [top research priorities](https://pmmrp.github.io) to establish an evidence base for the efficacy of a suite of multi-modal complementary treatments across a range of conditions, rather than just trialling a series of drugs for a particular condition. 

Implementing this approach alongside conventional acute care protocols can do no harm.

### Integration of physical and mental healthcare services 
NHS centres offer referrals to Allied Health Professions (AHP) services including dietitians, physiotherapists and psychologists - but only across a limited range of conditions.  In line with current directives from the World Health Organisation and national govenment policy on the need to integrate physical and mental healthcare services, NHS pilots report earlier and wider access to complementary therapeutic modalities will benefit service users, although there are minor issues to resolve including logistics of localities and improved inter-sector staff training (ref 9999, ref 9999, ref 9999).

Early access to nutrition support (including micronutrient supplements), physical therapies (active/passive), and resilience counselling to mitigate comorbid or standalone depression and anxiety disorders (DADs) will in addition to specific therapeutic benefits also extend patient support-networks and enable more professional feedback to inform collaborative clinical care pathway management for outpatients and for those in residential care (ref 9999). This move might prevent mild to moderate conditions degenerating to severe or even treatment resistant (ref 9999).

### Incorporation of complementary therapies into standard practice 
In order to ease the burden on NHS AHPs, a register of accredited complementary therapists is available for direct referral by other healthcare professionals, including referrals from AHPs themselves. It is proposed to assign NHS roles and permitted activities with consequent implications for funding and for updating the eletronic medical records system. Until this happens,
