title: "Research proposal - Delphi study: Key opinions of healthcare workers to inform improved service delivery towards reducing hospital admissions and reducing psychotropic drug trials" 
description: "Draft invitation to clinicians for participation in research project which will include longitudinal analysis of regional hospital admissions and psychotropic drug trials. It is expected that the hospital admissions and psychotropic drug trials will reduce significantly after introducing a standard triple approach for the patient group across the three modalities concurrently. The aim is standardisation of and widening access to these multi-modal recovery programmes for depression and anxiety disorders (DADs) with or without comorbidities (triple focus - nutrition supplements, physio/clinical exercise prescription, resilience counselling)."
