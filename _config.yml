title: "Research proposal - Delphi study. Key opinions of healthcare workers to inform improved service delivery. Aims: reducing hospital admissions, reducing length of time spent in hospitals, reducing psychotropic drug trials, standardisation of a triple focus approach (nutrition supplements, physio/clinical exercise prescription, resilience counselling), widening access to the standardised triple-approach to more patient groups" 
description: "Draft invitation to clinicians for participation in research project which will include longitudinal analysis of psychotropic drug trials, hospital admissions, and length of stay. Evidence from a literature review suggests hospital admissions/length of stay and psychotropic drug trials will reduce significantly after introducing a standard triple approach for the patient group depression and anxiety disorders (DADs) with or without comorbidities (triple focus - nutrition supplements, physio/clinical exercise prescription, resilience counselling)."
